# EvoDriveAI


**EvoDriveAI** is a Python-based simulation showcasing AI-driven autonomous vehicles navigating a procedurally generated wavy track. These vehicles are powered by evolving neural networks, optimized using genetic algorithms. Built with **Pygame**, this project is a hands-on exploration of artificial intelligence, neural networks, and evolutionary computation within a visual simulation environment.

- `S`: Save the current best neural network (if superior to the previous save).  
- `ESC`: Exit the simulation, saving the current best network automatically if available.

## How It Works

### Neural Network

Each vehicle is powered by a **feedforward neural network**. This network processes sensor inputs and makes movement decisions in real time.

- **Input Layer**: Distances from road borders, captured via simulated sensors, are normalized and passed to the network.  
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers analyze input data using weighted sums and activation functions to detect patterns.  
- **Output Layer**: Four control signalsâ€”forward, left, right, reverseâ€”determine how the car moves.

### Genetic Algorithm

The AI improves through evolutionary strategies:

- **Initialization**: The simulation starts with a population of vehicles with randomized neural networks.  
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Performance is scored based on distance traveled without crashing.  
- **Selection**: The highest-scoring vehicle is selected as the genetic base for the next generation.  
- **Mutation**: Its neural network is copied and slightly mutated to introduce new behaviors.  
- **Evolution**: This cycle repeats, allowing the AI to progressively learn better driving strategies.
